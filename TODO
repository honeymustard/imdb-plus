TODO for project imdb+:

 -> CONSIDER THIS:

  * secondary sorting. pros) easy to implement, cons) negligible value
  * add 'List stats' tab. pros) This would take minutes
  * add 'Comparison' tab. compare MyMovies <-> MyLists -> vs IMDB
  * add 'Other stats' tab. lists contain additional statistically significant information..

 -> TO BE FIXED:

  * put some statuses into statusbar.. it doesn't do anything.
  * build.sh: make sure correct files are copied, and that install paths work
  * allow/disallow hidden columns in table widget..

  * progress-bar doesn't work. it did, but now it doesn't. thoughts: none.
