TODO for project imdb-plus:

 -> CONSIDER THIS:

  * secondary sorting for tables..

  * add the following new tabs:

      * Comparison: Intersection of open lists: MyMovies -> MyLists
      * Top250 stats: How many top250 films have you seen..
      * Bottom100 stats: How many bottom100 films have you seen..
      * Box-office stats: How many box-office films have you seen..

 -> TO BE FIXED:
  
  * All appears to be well
