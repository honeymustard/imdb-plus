## TODO

**Considerations**
* add lists directory to enforce separation of lists/movies files

**Improvements**
* top lists. which list films appear in top lists also?
* add support for sort text in meta so one could sort 
  based on a value which is not the cell text.
  This will allow for strings like N/A to be sorted as 0
  in otherwise integer columns

**Non-Urgent fixes**
* none

**Urget fixes**
* none

**Known bugs**
* none
